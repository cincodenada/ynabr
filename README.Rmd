## YNABR - A 'You Need a Budget' API client for R

This is the beginnings of an API client for the [YNAB](http://www.youneedabudget.com) online budget software. This is
not even in "alpha" yet, as there are many function to adjust and add. The first stage
of this project is to make it easy to pull all of your budget and bank account data
from the YNAB API (v1) into R so that you can analyze it.

It is currently functional to pull a dump of your data, though you must have set up
API access and obtained a security token directly from YNAB. The basic workflow is

1) Set your token with ynab_set_token()
2) List your available budgets with ynab_list_budgets()
3) Pull your budget data of interest with ynab_get_budget()
